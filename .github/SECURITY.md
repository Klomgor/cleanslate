# Clean Slate security policy

## Supported versions

Clean Slate uses a **rolling release** model. This means only the most recent version of Clean Slate is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, **do not create an issue** in GitHub. Instead, email `contact@cleanslate.sh`. We will draft [a GitHub security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). Then, We will collaborate with you to get the patch released as quickly as possible.

Once, the patch is ready to go, we will:

- Push the code to main.
- Publish the security advisory to GitHub.
